# Spring Boot And Cassandra

This is an Apache Cassandra java client usage demo repository. In this demonstration a basic CRUD was created
for data manipulation: Create, Read, Update and Delete.

Originally created by Facebook, its architecture was inspired by Amazon's DynamoDB and its data model was based on
on Google's BigTable - as open source since 2008. It is currently maintained by the Apache foundation.
Cassandra is a non-relational and columnar database. Designed for scalability and high availability without compromising performance.
